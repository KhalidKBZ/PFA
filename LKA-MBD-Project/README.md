## 📋 Project Overview

Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) for lane keeping assistance, developed using 
**Model-Based Design (MBD)** methodology following automotive industry standards 
(**ISO 26262**, **SOTIF**). The system provides lateral control to maintain vehicle 
position within lane boundaries on highways.

**Key Features:**
- 🎯 Lane detection using computer vision (Hough transform)
- 🚗 Model Predictive Control (MPC) for optimal steering
- ⚠️ Comprehensive safety monitoring and fail-safe mechanisms
- 📊 Real-time performance: <50ms execution time target
- ✅ Automated V&V suite with comprehensive test coverage

---

## 🎯 Project Scope

**In Scope:**
- Highway driving at speeds 60-130 km/h
- Maintain vehicle position within ±0.3m of lane center with 95% reliability
- Handle straight roads and gentle curves (R>200m)
- Graceful deactivation on failures or driver override

**Out of Scope:**
- Sharp curves (<200m radius)
- Urban/city driving
- Construction zones with no lane markings
- Adverse weather (heavy rain, snow)
- Multi-lane changes

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Perception Module**: Camera-based lane detection with confidence scoring
- **Control Module**: MPC-based lateral controller with feedforward
- **Safety Monitor**: Plausibility checks, fault detection, and fail-safe logic
- **State Machine**: Mode management (Stateflow) with safe transitions
- **Actuation**: Steering command limiting and rate control
